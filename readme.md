Just a space-invaders style game to get gud at coding.  Following along with the
project in Python Crash Course, by Eric Matthes

3/17/20
    Started project
    Added main file, settings files, and ship class file

3/18/20
    Added ship movement
    Unfortunately did not get as much done as I would've liked due to work.

3/19/20
    -Implemented bullets and shooting
    -Started to add aliens to the game. So far, there is one static alien that
    chills in the corner doing nothing, with no collision :)
    -Also, as a side-note, I am figuring out git and think I've been doing a
    good job.

3/20/20
    -Added alien motion
    -Added finite life count
    -Added collision between ship, bullets, and aliens

3/21/20
    -Added a play button to start the game. Also shows up after game over
    -Added dynamic settings where the aliens speed up as waves are cleared

3/22/20
    -Started to implement scoring
    -Have a bug in scoreboard.py to fix
    -Wanted to be finished with this project today but looking like it won't be
    until tomorrow because I was giving Haven some math tutoring
